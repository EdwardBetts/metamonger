Description: metamonger - Store, restore, and diff filesystem metadata
 metamonger allows you to store, restore, and diff filesystem metadata like
 mtime, atime, uid, gid, etc. The storage backend is line-wise JSON; this makes
 it easy to both commit, track, and merge the data with a VCS like Git as well
 as edit the stored data by hand.
